									<h2><a href="#">Unilever Canteen Ordering System Project</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, our goal was to develop more efficient methods to reduce the time employees spend waiting for available tables during lunch hours. 
										We had a request from the employees to have a system that would allow canteen users to order meals online for delivery to their work location at a specified time and date.
										The system development process involved utilising tools such as the RACI Matrix, Business process mapping and Jira, among others.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Revenue Tracking 
											using Power BI<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Revenue Tracker.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> 
									A reputable company offering a diverse range of products was facing difficulties in maximizing their sales potential due to a lack of insight into key revenue factors. 
										As a business analyst, my role was to develop a revenue tracking dashboard that featured: total revenue, orders, and product quantities; a monthly revenue trend (preferably broken down by shipping route); the top 5 revenue-generating products and employees; and interactive filters for order date, supplier, and customer to provide a more customized analysis for management.</p>

									<p>A luxurious beachfront hotel management company, serving both leisure and business travelers, sought to gain a deeper understanding of their reservation data. Their aim was to obtain actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to improve guest experiences, streamline hotel operations, and boost revenue. 
										This analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and we accomplished this by gathering and structuring data on bookings, cancellations, customer preferences, and revenue.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Dashboard for Tailored Analysis<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/S & P dashboard.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A well-established clothing company
										offering a diverse range of apparel, struggled with a fragmented understanding of their sales performance and product trends. They depended on scattered data and guesswork for important decisions regarding product lines, marketing campaigns, and inventory management. This approach resulted in missed opportunities, inefficient inventory management, and a narrow marketing focus. To address these issues, we needed to create both a sales dashboard and a product dashboard. The dashboards featured metrics for total orders, revenue, goods sold, and customer count. They included monthly revenue trends, a map of revenue by country with detailed tooltips, top customers by revenue and order volume, and filters for year, gender, product category, and continent.
										This analysis was carried out utilising Power BI.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Automotive Quality Analysis Diagram<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/manufacturing.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A automotive manufacturing company had noticed some engine failures in its vehicles. These defects caused around 46 new vehicles to catch fire, resulting in production levels falling below market expectations and thus failing to generate the anticipated sales revenue. As a business analyst, I was tasked with conducting a gap analysis using a fishbone diagram to pinpoint the root causes in order to improve productivity.</p>
